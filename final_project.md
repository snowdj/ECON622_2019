# Final Project
## Dates
* Final project **proposal due** on **November 27th**
  * The writeup for this can be very short (e.g. 1/2 page or whatever), just so we can all agree on whether it is acceptable.
  * It will not be graded.  If we think that the proposal is inappropriate, or want some clarifications, we will tell you that week
* The final project is **due December 18th**

## Requirements
We will accept a wide-range of proposals on many different topics.  The key requirements are that:
* There is some element of practicing your coding skills (in Julia preferably).
* The project must be submitted as a git repository.
   - In addition to your code and other files, please include a brief README.md 
   - If you make your git repository public, we strongly encourage you to include a LICENSE file, so that others know whether and under what conditions they can modify and redistribute your code. If you want others to use your code, the Julia community prefers the permissive MIT license. You could also consider a copyleft licenses, like the GPL, or, at the other extreme, retaining exclusive copyright.
* The practice is on a tool with the intention of learning something which would be useful for doing your own research (e.g. replicating an estimation procedure, adding some new examples to a public package for some econometric procedure, doing a web scraping exercise to generate new datasource, etc.)
* While it is not encouraged, we will consider joint projects with other classes - but make sure to tell us your plans, and understand our expectations of the amount of work will be adjusted. 
* Group projects are allowed, but make sure to get our approval.
   - Groups must use github (or another git platform) to coordinate their work. This means creating a repository, planning the project by creating issues, group members working on the issues in separate branches, creating pull requests, merging the work together, and then repeating as needed.

## Size of Project and Grading Criteria
You should target roughly a similar length as the amount of code in one of the Jupyter notebooks used for lectures.  If you are contributing to an open-source project, then the contribution can be significantly smaller as it would require more work to iterate.

If you want to get the highest possible marks on the project, you will need to:
 * Create a thorough set of tests for your project
 * Carefully creating tests for each individual function rather than writing out the code all the way to the solution.
 * Ensure that it runs with continuous integration (i.e. Travis) and with code-coverage
 * Ensure that the project is reproducible (i.e. someone else can run the code without any modifications)
 * Demonstrate some use of generic programming (for Julia)
 
 If you are able to make a contribution to an existing open-source project, it is preferred. For contributions to existing projects, we will consider more modest goals since we realize it adds rigors of testing/documentation/etc.
